## Detailed

The user starts by answering a couple of questions concerning his/her mental health. For example, "How many hours have you slept?". The user can go through
these questions as many times as he/she wants in a day. The questions are randomized, resulting in a different list of questions every time.

After the user has provided input, the app provides grades on each health category (sleep, eating and etc.). After showing the results, the app provides tips 
that are relevant to the user's results on each categor. These stats are adjusted, in a weighted manner, every time the user gives additional input. 

Moreover the app has a calendar, which allows the user the see their mental stats for each day, as well as, log their mood and feelings for a specific day in writing.
